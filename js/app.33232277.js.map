With the adoption of 3D printing technologies, visually impaired students and teachers will have more access to 3D printed tactile models. We designed Talkit++, an iOS application that plays audio and visual content as a user touches parts of a 3D print. With Talkit++, a visually impaired student can explore a printed model tactilely and use hand gestures and speech commands to get more information about certain elements in the model. Talkit++ detects the model and hand gestures using computer vision algorithms, simple accessories like paper stickers and printable trackers, and the built-in RGB camera on an iOS device. Based on the model’s position and the user’s input, Talkit++ speaks textual information, plays audio recordings, and displays visual animations.\",\n  title2: \"FULL CITATION\",\n  content2:\n    \"Lei Shi, Zhuohao Zhang, and Shiri Azenkot.

However, it is unknown how an I3M should be designed to serve as an effective teaching aid. To address this gap, we conducted two studies with Teachers of the Visually Impaired (TVIs). First, we led two design workshops with 35 TVIs, who modified sample models and added interactive elements to them. Second, we worked with three TVIs to design three I3Ms in an iterative instructional design process. At the end of this process, the TVIs used the I3Ms we designed to teach their students. We conclude that I3Ms should (1) have effective tactile features (e.g., distinctive patterns between components), (2) contain both auditory and visual content (e.g., explanatory animations), and (3) consider pedagogical methods (e.g., overview before details).\",\n  title2: \"FULL CITATION\",\n  content2:\n    \"Lei Shi, Holly M.

To solve this issue, they tend to join a social network like an older adult’s support group; However, they can still face the same challenge due to the lack of deeper connections within the group. The feeling of disconnection and isolation can lead to mental disorders. We present WeCare, a foldable four screens voice user interface (VUI) tool that supports retired elder's mental wellness through collaborative storytelling. During the process, older adults engage in a metaphorical way of revisiting, reflecting and reinterpreting their life experience by collaboratively making up a story based on a picture provided by the device. WeCare promotes bonding within a small group, helps older adults to be heard and feel the sense of connection and empowerment.\",\n  title2: \"Acknowledgement\",\n  content2:\n    \"I work with Zhaoyuan Su (UIUC), Fan Lin (CCA), Zhou Yu (Princeton) on this project.

The technique, called GPK (Gliding on Physical Keyboard), consists of two steps for entering special symbols. First, a user draws the special symbol on the keyboard by gliding over keys; Second, the user can select the desired symbol from the predicted symbols generated by GPK. Users can also switch from this mode to normal typing mode. We also present an application of this input technique based on web browsers. A user study with nine participants who are familiar with keyboard input showed the input efficiency of GPK. We compared the typing efficiency of GPK with other special symbol typing methods. We could deploy this method to office environments where users have desktop computers with a keyboard only. It could also inspire future work of integrating this method into word processors, document preparation systems and web environments.\",\n  title2: \"ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\",\n  content2:\n    \"I work with another ZJU student Xiyuan He on this project.
