With the adoption of 3D printing technologies, visually impaired students and teachers will have more access to 3D printed tactile models. We designed Talkit++, an iOS application that plays audio and visual content as a user touches parts of a 3D print. With Talkit++, a visually impaired student can explore a printed model tactilely and use hand gestures and speech commands to get more information about certain elements in the model. Talkit++ detects the model and hand gestures using computer vision algorithms, simple accessories like paper stickers and printable trackers, and the built-in RGB camera on an iOS device. Based on the model’s position and the user’s input, Talkit++ speaks textual information, plays audio recordings, and displays visual animations.\",\n  title2: \"FULL CITATION\",\n  content2:\n    \"Lei Shi, Zhuohao Zhang, Shiri Azenkot.2018.

When a user tactilely explored these areas, Talkit spoke their labels. Talkit++ is a new version that supports multiple types of output information, scalable 2D trackers (used for tracking the models with computer vision), and iOS compatibility. Besides descriptive textual information (e.g., the name of a bird), Talkit++ also supports audio recordings (e.g., the sound a bird makes) and visual animations (e.g., the animation of a flying bird). In addition to 3D trackers, Talkit++ also supports 2D trackers.\"\n  },\n  {\n    question: \"How was it developed?\",\n    answer:\n      \"Talkit++ was developed in Swift and C++. To locate a model, Talkit++ uses Chilitags, which provides the coordinates of 2D and 3D trackers. Based on these coordinates, the system calculates the real-world coordinates of the model, and tracks a user’s red sticker using OpenCV. We cross compiled Chilitags and OpenCV and called them in Swift. After locating the model, Talkit++ provides output information based on the location of the sticker. As for speech input, Talkit++ uses Swift’s built-in speech dictation functions.\"\n  },\n  {\n    question: \"What's your future goal of this project?\",\n    answer:\n      \"In the future, we plan to make the application available to the public.

However, it is unknown how an I3M should be designed to serve as an effective teaching aid. To address this gap, we conducted two studies with Teachers of the Visually Impaired (TVIs). First, we led two design workshops with 35 TVIs, who modified sample models and added interactive elements to them. Second, we worked with three TVIs to design three I3Ms in an iterative instructional design process. At the end of this process, the TVIs used the I3Ms we designed to teach their students. We conclude that I3Ms should (1) have effective tactile features (e.g., distinctive patterns between components), (2) contain both auditory and visual content (e.g., explanatory animations), and (3) consider pedagogical methods (e.g., overview before details).\",\n  title2: \"Acknowledgement\",\n  content2:\n    \"This work is an extension of Markit & Talkit and Talkit++.

The successful deployment of our model in Alibaba demonstrated that our model, as well as the data set we constructed, are practical and valuable for industrial level application.\"\n  }\n];\n","\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimport { Component, Vue, Mixins } from \"vue-property-decorator\";\nimport wrap from \"./components/wrap.vue\";\nimport HeadWrap from \"./components/HeadWrap.vue\";\nimport BorderWrap from \"./components/BorderWrap.vue\";\nimport DownloadButton from \"./components/DownloadButton.vue\";\nimport PicWrap from \"./components/PicWrap.vue\";\nimport AskQuestion from \"./components/AskQuestion.vue\";\nimport { information, atlas, QA } from \"@/data/portfolio/7\";\nimport MyMixin from \"@/mixin\";\n\n@Component({\n  components: {\n    wrap,\n    HeadWrap,\n    BorderWrap,\n    DownloadButton,\n    PicWrap,\n    AskQuestion\n  }\n})\nexport default class portfolio1 extends Mixins(MyMixin) {\n  information: object = information;\n  atlas: object[] = atlas;\n  QAs: object[] = QA;\n\n  mounted() {\n    this.inView();\n  }\n}\n","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/ts-loader/index.js??ref--12-2!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./7.vue?vue&type=script&lang=ts&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/ts-loader/index.js??ref--12-2!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./7.vue?vue&type=script&lang=ts&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./7.vue?vue&type=template&id=16232112&scoped=true&lang=pug&\"\nimport script from \"./7.vue?vue&type=script&lang=ts&\"\nexport * from \"./7.vue?vue&type=script&lang=ts&\"\nimport style0 from \"./7.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=16232112&lang=stylus&scoped=true&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  \"16232112\",\n  null\n  \n)\n\ncomponent.options.__file = \"7.vue\"\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"wallcontroller\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"background\"}),_c('head-wrap',{attrs:{\"title\":_vm.information.heading,\"content\":_vm.information.introduction}}),_c('div',{staticClass:\"wrapper\"},[_c('wrap',{attrs:{\"title\":_vm.information.title1,\"content\":_vm.information.content1}}),_c('h2',{staticClass:\"nov\"},[_vm._v(\"Working in Progress...Launching on NOV.\")]),_c('gc-copyright')],1)],1)}\nvar staticRenderFns = []\n\nexport { render, staticRenderFns }","export const information = {\n  heading: \"WallController\",\n  introduction: \"Intelligent Interactive System\",\n  title1: \"Introduction\",\n  content1:\n    \"This an iOS project interacting with visualization application presented on large display walls.
